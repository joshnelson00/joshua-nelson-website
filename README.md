- Typing animations simulate real terminal behavior
- Blinking cursor effect for authentic terminal feel

### Scroll-Based Section Detection

- Automatically detects which section is currently in view
- Updates active navigation state based on scroll position
- Synchronizes terminal path display with current section
- Smooth scrolling with proper header offset calculation

- Adaptive navigation that works on all device sizes
- Consistent styling and behavior across breakpoints
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
